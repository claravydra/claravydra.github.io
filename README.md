Visualizations and maps I have created for university projects, internships or just for fun.

## Showcase maps
Experimenting with the Globe Builder Plugin in QGIS, I created this map showing the global rail network, with each railway connection as an individual vector line.

I created this map for day 3 of the 30 day map challenge, which was all about polygons. Had my first experiments using Affinity.
